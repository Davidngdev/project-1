                    <h1>God's Message for this day.</h1>
                    <p>The Message of the Hour is an app that aims to present a balanced view of the End-Time Message by connecting the tapes with Scriptures. The app's goal is to demonstrate a clear agreement between God's Word and Brother Branham's teachings.</p>
                    <p>Branham believed in positive confession. He required supplicants to claim to be healed to demonstrate their faith, even if they were still experiencing symptoms. He frequently told supplicants to expect their symptoms to remain for several days after their healing.</p>
